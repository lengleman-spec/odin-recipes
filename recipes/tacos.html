      <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 325 &deg;F. Fill a pot
          with water and bring to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start the sauce: Add guajillo, arbol, and ancho chile peppers to the
          boiling water. Boil for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove pot from the heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. Drain,
          reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels.
          Cut beef into chunks if desired, and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook
          until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the beef is searing, continue the sauce: Line a heavy cast-iron
          grill pan or griddle with alumninum foil and place over high heat.
          Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. Grill until tomato skin is
          burned on all sided and begins to peel, 3-5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place cooled chile peppers into a blender. Add grilled tomatoes,
          vinegar, garlic, 2 tsp black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme,
          marjoram, oregano, and salt in a blender. Pour in the reserved 1/4 cup
          of chile water and blend until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned meat
          in the Ducth oven, turning the roast so it is completely covered with
          sauce, cover with a lid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce,
          until birria begins to fall apart, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the lid and
          bake, uncovered, until birria is crispy on top, about 20 minutes.
          Remove from oven, cover with 2 layers of alumninum foil, and allow to
          rest in a warm area for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove meat to a cutting board and strain off any excess fat from the
          sauce. Shred meat with two forks, and return meat to the pot and stir
          with the sauce until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble and heat the tacos: Fill each tortilla with birria meat and
          top with Mexican cheese, chopped onion, and cilantro. Warm tortillas
          on a griddle, flipping until both sides are crispy and cheese is
          melted.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with consome and enjoy!</li>
